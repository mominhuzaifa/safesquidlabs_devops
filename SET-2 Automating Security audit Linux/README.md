Linux Server Security Audit and Hardening Script
Introduction
This repository contains a Bash script designed to automate the security audit and hardening process for Linux servers. The script is modular and reusable, making it easy to deploy across multiple servers. It performs various security checks, applies hardening measures, and generates a detailed report, ensuring that your servers meet stringent security standards.

Features
User and group audits, including checks for UID 0 and weak passwords.
File and directory permissions audits, including checks for world-writable files and SUID/SGID bits.
Service audits to ensure only authorized services are running.
Firewall and network security checks, including port scans and IP configuration audits.
IP and network configuration checks for public vs. private IP addresses.
Security updates and patch management.
Log monitoring for suspicious activities.
Server hardening, including SSH configuration, IPv6 disabling, GRUB bootloader security, and firewall rules.
Customizable security checks using a configuration file.
Reporting and optional email alerts for critical vulnerabilities.
Prerequisites
A Linux server with Bash installed.
Root or sudo access to perform security checks and apply hardening measures.
An email service configured if you want to enable email alerts.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linux-security-audit-hardening.git
cd linux-security-audit-hardening
Make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x security_audit_hardening.sh
(Optional) Customize the script:

Edit the script to add or modify security checks as needed.
Create a custom_checks.sh file in /etc/security/ for additional custom security checks.
(Optional) Configure email alerts:

Ensure that mail is installed and configured on your server.
Uncomment the email alert line in the generate_report() function of the script and update the email address.
Usage
To run the security audit and hardening script, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo ./security_audit_hardening.sh
The script will generate a report and save it to /var/log/security_audit_YYYYMMDD.log, where YYYYMMDD is the date of the audit.

Example
bash
Copy code
sudo ./security_audit_hardening.sh
Output:

arduino
Copy code
Starting security audit and hardening process...
Generating security audit and hardening report...
Report saved to /var/log/security_audit_20240824.log
Process completed.
Customization
Adding Custom Security Checks
You can extend the script with your custom security checks by creating a custom_checks.sh file in the /etc/security/ directory. The script will automatically execute this file if it exists.

Example of custom_checks.sh:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
echo "Custom security check: Checking for specific configuration..."
# Add your custom security checks here
Customizing the Script
Feel free to modify the script to meet your specific requirements. Each function in the script handles a different aspect of the security audit or hardening process, so you can easily add, remove, or modify functions as needed.

Reporting and Alerts
The script generates a summary report of the security audit and hardening process, highlighting any issues that need attention. Reports are saved to the /var/log/ directory with a timestamp.

If configured, the script can also send an email alert if critical vulnerabilities or misconfigurations are found. To enable email alerts, uncomment the relevant line in the generate_report() function and update the email address.
